SOME STLS THAT I UPLOADED ARE A MESS, SORRY FOR THIS, WILL FIX SOON

------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT ----------------------------------------------
This mod will extend the width of your existing switchwire by roughly 4cm. 
The mod does NOT require you to modify your existing Switchwire frame. The extrusions bolt onto it.

I don't like the default VHB enclosure, i want something more rigid. MakerbeamXL 1515 extrusions are cheap and small, perfect for supporting an enclosure. 

------------------------------------------- MAKERBEAM ----------------------------------------------
Required extrusions for full enclosure:
6x MakerBeamXL 490mm (vertical extrusions x4 + top front-to-back extrusions x2)
2x MakerBeamXL 360mm (top front & top rear)
