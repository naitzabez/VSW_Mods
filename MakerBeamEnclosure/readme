This mod will extend the width of your existing switchwire by roughly 4cm. 
The mod does NOT require you to modify your existing intact Switchwire, it's purely an addon.

I don't like the default VHB enclosure, i want something more rigid. MakerbeamXL 1515 extrusions are cheap and small, perfect for supporting an enclosure. 

------------------------------------------- MAKERBEAM ----------------------------------------------
Required extrusions for full enclosure:
6x MakerBeamXL 490mm (vertical extrusions x4 + top front-to-back extrusions x2)
2x MakerBeamXL 360mm (top front & top rear) 

The width of the switchwire is 360mm, the length is 520mm and height is 490mm. 
Because we blindjoint all the makerbeams, the ones that goes on the length needs to be 490mm just like the ones that are vertical as the 
vertical extrusions themselves removes 15mm from each side (520-30 = 490) of the top extrusion. Because we attach the vertical extrusions on the 
side the ones on the top front and top rear stay 360mm. 

Estimated cost as of 2021-09-27:

8x 500mm extrusions      = 52eu
8x cuts                  = 24eu
Tot (excluding shipping) = 76eu

Apart from the extrusions, there's also a plethora of STLS that makes the switchwire look more gucci including "360" skirts to complete the look. 
Theres also jigs for drilling holes for blindjoins.
