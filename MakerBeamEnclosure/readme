I don't like the default VHB enclosure, i want something more rigid. MakerbeamXL 1515 extrusions are cheap and small, perfect for supporting an enclosure. 

Required extrusions for full enclosure:
8x MakerBeamXL 490mm 
2x MakerBeamXL 360mm

Apart from the extrusions, there's also a plethora of STLS that makes the switchwire look more gucci including "360" skirts to complete the look. Theres also jigs for drilling.
