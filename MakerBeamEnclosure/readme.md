This mod will extend the width of your existing switchwire by roughly 4cm. 
The mod does NOT require you to modify your existing Switchwire frame. The extrusions bolt onto it.

I don't like the default VHB enclosure, i want something more rigid. MakerbeamXL 1515 extrusions are cheap and small, perfect for supporting an enclosure. 


Required extrusions for full enclosure:
6x MakerBeamXL 490mm (vertical extrusions x4 + top front-to-back extrusions x2)
2x MakerBeamXL 360mm (top front & top rear) 


The clips that hold all the panels are using magnets for quick removal. If you wish to use screwed clips you may want to edit some of the skirts to add inserts. The 15-30 joint is what mates the 1515 extrusions & 3030 extrusions on the top.
